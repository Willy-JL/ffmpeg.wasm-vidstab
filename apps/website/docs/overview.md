## Introduction

ffmpeg.wasm is a pure WebAssembly / JavaScript port of [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
enabling video & audio record, convert and stream right inside browsers.

We leverage
[Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) to transpile FFmpeg source code and many
libraries to WebAssembly and develop a minimal but essential library to free
developers from common requirements like running ffmpeg inside web worker and
more.

## Advantages

- **Security**: your users' data only lives inside their browser, no need to
    worry about any data leakage or network latency.
- **Client-side computing**: instead of hosting a cluster of server-end servers,
    you can now offload multimedia processing to client-side.
- **Flexible**: ffmpeg.wasm comes with single-thread and multi-thread cores, you
    can use whichever fits your use case.

## Architecture

![architecture](/img/ffmpegwasm-arch.png)

Multimedia transcoding is a resource-intensive task that you don't want to
execute in main thread, thus in ffmpeg.wasm we offload those task to web worker
(`ffmpeg.worker`) by default. This makes almost all function calls in ffmpeg.wasm
are asynchronous and it is recommended to use **async** / **await** syntax.

`ffmpeg.worker` downloads WebAssembly code (`ffmpeg-core`) from CDN
and initialized it in WorkerGlobalScope. For any input video file you would like
to process, you need to first populated them inside ffmpeg-core File System and
also read result from `ffmpeg-core` File System once it is done.

If you are using a multi-thread version of `ffmpeg-core`, more web workers will
be spawned by `ffmpeg-core` inside `ffmpeg.worker`

:::info
The concept of `core` in ffmpeg.wasm is like the engine of a car, it is not only
the most important part of ffmpeg.wasm but also a swappable component. Currently
we maintain single-thread (`@ffmpeg/core`) and multi-thread version
(`@ffmpeg/core-mt`) cores, you can build your own core (ex. a core with x264
 lib only to minimize ffmpeg-core.wasm file size) using build scripts in the repository.
